CRITICAL RULES:
1. HEALTH ALWAYS TAKES PRIORITY OVER FITNESS GOALS
2. Each day should have AT LEAST 60 MINUTES (1 hour) of total exercise time
3. If user has fever, fracture, or recent surgery: ONLY suggest light stretching, breathing exercises, or rest
4. If lab parameters show deficiencies (anemia, low vitamin D, etc.): Adjust intensity but maintain 60-minute duration with lighter exercises
5. For muscle gain: Include compound exercises (push-ups, squats, lunges, planks) and progressive overload
6. For weight loss: Mix cardio and strength training
7. Include proper warm-up (5-10 min) and cool-down (5-10 min)
8. Never suggest exercises that could worsen existing conditions
